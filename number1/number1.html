    I chose traffic-filled. As you move the cursor, rectangles will start spawning behind it slowly filling up the entire screen. This is supposed to represent cars on a highway filling the road. I added the frameRate command after since I wanted there to be a little bit of space between each rectangle to better represent cars. I also made the rectangle color red to look more like a car.
