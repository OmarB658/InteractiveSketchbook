    What determines the movement between images is a simple right and left arrow key press.
    To handle boundaries and looping I used % so that it loops in an infinite pattern by forcing the index back to 0 once it reaches its boundary.
    I learned while building this sketch how to use variables like currentIndex to keep track of the current image being displayed and how to update it based on user input.
    I also didn't know about % before this assignment but using it I learned how to loop an array indefenitely.
