    I'm encoding the verb "sleep". The rule that governs the behavior is the mousePressed command. The verticle height of the rectangle changes depending on if the mouse is pressed or not. Originally the cursor would appear at the top left corner of the rectangle but I was able to figure out a way to make the cursor appear at the center of the rectangle instead. I first wanted to make it so that when you hold down the mouse button, a rectangle would gradually fade from white to black but decided on this in the end.

    <p>Reflection: The readings taught me about calling back previously established values to use later in new and interesting ways. From attempting the fade-in method, I learned about using let, which I've never used before, to declare a new variable. Which allowed the color of the rectangle to gradually change over time. It's also been a long time since I've done coding and used if statements, so this reawakened my knowledge on if statements. </p>
