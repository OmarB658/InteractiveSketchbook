    Modularizing the code has shifted my focus from creating a single script to building an interactive machine where the logic,
    graphics, and navigation work as different components that are all connected. In my sketch I added an unlock bar that fills
    up as you hold the space bare, and once it's full, you can press left or right to go to the next or previous image. This sketch communicates more clearly
    by using a progress bar that tells you when you can go to the next image. This also makes it feel more controlled by allowing the user to control when they can and can not
    navigate to the next image.
