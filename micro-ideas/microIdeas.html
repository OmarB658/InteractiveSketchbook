    1. Get lucky <p>
    Some people get lucky at the casino, while other people lose it all.
    <p>
    The input is a simple mouse click. Every time you click, there's a 50% chance that one square moves up a bit,while the other square has a 1% chance to move up.
    This second square also has a 10% chance to move all the way back to the bottom, symbolizing losing it all. Over time,
    what changes is the height of the first square as it gets luckier and luckier. The unevenness appears as the first square pulls way ahead of the unlucky square.
    </p>
    The intended feeling is frustration as the unlucky circle refuses to grow, no matter how much you click <p>
    </p>

    2. The rich get richer
    <p>
    The rich get richer while the poor get poorer.
    <p>
    On the screen, there will be two circles, one big and one small. Every time you click, the big circle will grow by 50% in height,
    while the small circle grows by a flat 5% more. The size of the bigger circle will change over time as you click and it will continue to grow exponentially.</p>
    <p>
    This symbolizes unfairness as the circle that started bigger will exponentially grow larger over time, while the smaller one grows at a linear rate and very slowly.
    <p>

    </p>

    3. Priority queue
    <p>
    Some people have to wait in line, while others get to pay to skip it.
    <p>
    This would have two squares on the screen. The input would be a mouse click again, and whenever you click,
    square A moves up one step up. Every 10 clicks, square B moves up one step, which symbolizes faster queue times for people with money.
    </p>
    The intended feeling is, once again, that of privilege. People with more money get to bypass long queue times, therefore symbolizing privilege.
